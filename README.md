Happy Shopping is a basic e-commerce website built using the Laravel PHP framework.

It is part of our final year engineering project along with a Hadoop program to generate recommendations for e-commerce users.

Everything from the database design to writing the controllers and views has been done by yours truly. The site wouldn't be ready in time without the help of [@DaemonDhruv](https://github.com/DaemonDhruv) who helped me with the front-end.

I also wanted to make an Android app which receives data via a REST API to complement the website, but we never had such time to begin with :(

I found Laravel to be a beautifully designed web app framework, I am enjoying working with it :)
